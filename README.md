# My Project Euler Solutions
My work on the Project Euler problems, found here https://projecteuler.net/archives

I have provided my solutions here for code review and demonstration purposes, to act as a history for improvements, and for other people doing the problems to compare their own solutions.

My intention is not for people to use this to look up the correct solution, that is not in the spirit of the competition.
It really is rewarding to figure out a solution to a problem on your own.
